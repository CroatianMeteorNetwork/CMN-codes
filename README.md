CMN-codes
=========

  * ## CMN website
  
  A complete code for the Croatian Meteor Network Website currently located at http://cmn.rgn.hr/

  * ## CMNdownloader 
  
  Python script used to automatically (some data is downloaded daily, some every 6 hours) download images from CMOR radar and NASA fireball network, and their corresponding data from the same websites. The data is located in .txt format or in html code and is saved in .txt format

  * ## HMM_radio2txt
  
  Converting WAV files to *.txt format
  Header of the output file tells you the amount of samples per second and the number of chunks it has been reduced to.
  Other lines are in the following format: (sample_no) (level)

  * ## antialiasing 
    
  A test project I used to introduce myself to image processing with python. It is a slow and non-optimized brute-force approach and uses loops. A very bad code indeed.
  I don't have any intention to improve it, as it was just a quick introductory exercise. Use at your own risk.
